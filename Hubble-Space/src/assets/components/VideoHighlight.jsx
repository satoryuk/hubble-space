          Hubble celebrated its 34th year in orbit by premiering a stunning new Hubble image of the Little Dumbbell Nebula, an expanding shell of gas around an aging or dying star. After more than three decades, Hubble continues to uncover the mysteries of the universe. These are a few science achievements from Hubble's latest year in orbit.
